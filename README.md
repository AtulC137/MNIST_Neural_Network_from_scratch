# MNIST_Neural_Network_from_scratch
I have made the Basic Neural Network from scratch using python Tensorflow and keras. I have made three different models  

1. Basic_Model : no scalling 
2. Scalled_Model : scalled
3. Layered_Model : Scalled + hidden layer

# 🧠 ML Model Evaluation & Visualization

This project contains three machine learning models built using TensorFlow and evaluated on a classification dataset. It includes a colorful confusion matrix visualization using Seaborn and is runnable in a virtual environment with Jupyter Notebook.

## 📦 Features

- Three models: `Basic_Model`, `Scaled_Model`, `Layered_Model`
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy & Loss
- Confusion matrix heatmaps for each model
- Virtual environment setup script for reproducibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
### 2️⃣ Run Setup Script (Windows)
Use the pre-built batch file to automatically set up everything:

bash
Copy
Edit
setup_env.bat
This will:

🐍 Create and activate a virtual environment (myenv)

📦 Install all required packages

🧪 Register the Jupyter kernel as Python (myenv)

### 3️⃣ Start Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Then open main.ipynb and choose the kernel:
🧪 Python (myenv)

### 📊 Output
Sample confusion matrix heatmap:

### 🧰 Requirements
If you'd rather install manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow ipykernel
Or use the provided requirements.txt:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
